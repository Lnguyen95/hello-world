# Hello-world
Module 1 Introduction

Greeting everyone,

My name is Luc Nguyen, and like most of the people in the class I also major in CTSD and I’ve completed my AS degree back in 2018. Ever since I’ve been in searching specifically for bachelor’s degree in software program but there not much program out that fit my schedule. So, I am glad that Valencia finally open this program, and in this course my goal is increase my knowledge in coding, plus able to learn from those who has much more experience than I do. My favorite thing to do is working on cars, like my recent project was converting my 1992 mustang v4 to an v8 and yes I am a car enthusiastic also I enjoy watching action movie plus all marvel movies.
